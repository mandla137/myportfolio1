								<h1>Introduction</h1>
								<p>Once again, welcome to my portfolio. Take this journey with me as I will usher you in to the very core of who<br> Mandla Ndabambi really is.<br><br>
									Born and raised in Midrand, Gauteng, South Africa, I have been exposed to technology pretty much
									all my<br> life. This drove me towards having this sheer passion for
									technology in all its broad spectrum.<br><br>
									Having moved to Lesotho in the year 2004 I noticed at a very young that Lesotho is left behind in as far<br> as technology is involved. Upon completing my Form 5, I experimented with various technologies of <br>that time. This included exploring Microsoft DOS, Windows XP-2010, as well as becoming a <br>self-taught graphic designer.<br><br>Realizing that I can make a career out of my explorations, I then futhered my studies at The Vaal University <br>of Technology, where I became a certified Network administrator. I further pursued my Hon. in IT at LUCT,<br> as is on-going and have thus acquired web-develoment skills.</p>
